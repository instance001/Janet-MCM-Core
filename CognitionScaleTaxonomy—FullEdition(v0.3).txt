0. Abstract

This document defines a four-class cognition taxonomy and provides the formal boundaries, engineering requirements, and failure-mode analyses required to safely classify and compose artificial cognition systems.

It introduces:

LCM – Large Cognition Model (human minds)

LLM – Large Language Model

MCM – Modest Cognition Model (deterministic, bounded reasoning systems)

SCM – Simple Cognition Model (classical automation)


Included:

MCM Compliance Checklist (normative; 10-category certification)

Deeper Explanation Annex (examples + rationale)

Drift & Failure Modes Annex (systemic risks + mitigation)


This is a conservative taxonomy, intentionally non-anthropomorphic, designed to prevent category slippage and preserve clarity across engineering, governance, and public communication.


---

1. Purpose

The goals of this taxonomy are to:

Provide hard class boundaries to prevent conflation of human and artificial cognition.

Establish safe vocabulary for researchers, developers, policymakers, and users.

Define where deterministic systems (MCMs) sit relative to stochastic LLMs.

Enable safe AI braiding between cognition classes.

Give implementers enforceable criteria to classify their systems correctly.

2. High-Level Overview of Cognition Classes

2.1 LCM — Large Cognition Model (Human Minds)

Biological cognition

Subjective experience

Emotions, preferences, identity

Moral standing

Autobiographical memory


Reserved exclusively for humans (and, by future explicit consensus, potentially some biological animals).


---

2.2 LLM — Large Language Model

Stochastic pattern generator

Learns correlations from large corpora

No explicit world model

Not a reasoning engine

No internal truth-checking

Appears intelligent but lacks grounding


LLMs are probabilistic simulators, not cognitive entities.


---

2.3 MCM — Modest Cognition Model

A deterministic, bounded reasoning system with:

explicit memory

transparent state

hard safety constraints

human-gated skills

traceable decision-making


MCMs provide the governor spine around LLMs and tools.


---

2.4 SCM — Simple Cognition Model

Classical automation (rules, scripts, FSMs)

Fully deterministic

No learning unless reprogrammed

Narrow and brittle


Forms the “bottom layer” of safe composite systems.


---

3. Core Design Principles

1. Non-Equivalence:
No artificial system is classified as LCM.


2. Boundary Enforcement:
Systems must not quietly drift into another cognition class.


3. Complementarity:
MCMs complement LLMs.
SCMs complement MCMs.
LLMs remain stochastic, never deterministic.


4. Anthropomorphism Control:
Language must not imply subjective experience in non-LCM systems.




---

4. Formal Definitions & Boundaries

4.1 LCM – Large Cognition Model

Definition:
A human or biological cognition system with subjective experience and moral standing.

Permitted properties:

Sentience

Emotion

Identity

Will, preference, intent

Moral agency


Forbidden for artificial classes:

No LLM/MCM/SCM may be described or marketed with these traits.


---

4.2 LLM – Large Language Model

Definition:
A statistical next-token prediction system based on weight matrices.

Permitted:

Stochastic sampling

Apparent reasoning

Pattern recognition

Implicit knowledge in weights


Forbidden (LCM boundary):

Claims of selfhood

Emotion, intent

Consciousness

Moral status


Relationship:

LLMs provide proposals, not decisions.
They must be overseen by an MCM or SCM.


---

Properties:

Deterministic

No learning

Fully explicit logic

High reliability for narrow tasks


Relationship:

SCMs can be embedded within MCMs.


---

5. Drift & Boundary Rules

1. No upward anthropomorphic drift
LLM → “proto-person” presentation is forbidden.


2. MCM safety guarantees must hold
Failure of determinism, memory clarity, or policy enforcement disqualifies MCM status.


3. Substrate separation

LLM → stochastic weights

MCM → deterministic code + explicit memory

SCM → fixed rules

LCM → biological cognition



4. Hybrid systems must retain class purity for each component
No blending.




---

6. AI Braiding (Layered Cognition)

A safe composite system typically follows:

SCM → MCM → LLM → User (LCM)

Roles:

SCM: hard-coded safety checks

MCM: orchestrates, manages memory, applies policy

LLM: creative synthesis

LCM: final moral agent


MCM holds final authority over LLM.


---
