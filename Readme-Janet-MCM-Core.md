🧠 JANET – Modest Cognition Model (MCM)

Deterministic Architecture. Explicit Memory. Human-Gated Reasoning.

Janet is the reference implementation of a Modest Cognition Model (MCM) —
a new cognition class designed to solve the two core failures of neural AI:

✔ unpredictability

✔ uninspectability

MCMs reject statistical prediction entirely.
Instead, they operate through:

deterministic selectors

fully modular skills

typed explicit memory

strict schema validation

human-gated curriculum growth

transparent, auditable reasoning steps


Janet is the world’s first open, documented, fully reproducible MCM framework.

Everything is licensed AGPLv3 to ensure it remains part of the digital commons.

🧩 Why MCMs Matter

Modern AI is powerful, but fragile:

LLMs hallucinate.

They cannot be audited.

Their internal state cannot be inspected.

They drift, forget, and behave inconsistently.

They require enormous hardware and proprietary cloud access.


Governments, educators, safety labs, and industry all face the same problem:

“How do we get reliable, deterministic, locally-run AI?”

MCMs provide the answer.

Janet’s architecture is:

safe by design

modular

transparent

lightweight

local-first

educationally aligned

fully reproducible


This makes MCMs ideal for:

public institutions

safety research

regulated environments

education & curriculum design

low-resource regions

deterministic automation

🧱 Core Architectural Principles 

1. Deterministic Execution

Every cognitive step is explicit, inspectable, and reproducible.

2. Skill-Based Cognition

Knowledge lives in skills, not hidden parameters.

3. Structured Selectors

Janet uses schema-based routing to choose the correct skill.

4. Typed Memory Spine

Memory is a human-curated, structured knowledge ledger.
No hidden layers. No embeddings. No drift.

5. Curriculum Growth

New skills must be approved by a human supervisor before integration.

6. Zero Hallucination

Ambiguity is rejected, never guessed.

This is the opposite of LLM behaviour — by design.

💙 Purpose Statement

> Janet exists to provide the world with a safe, deterministic, inspectable alternative to neural AI — one that anyone can run, study, and improve.

The goal is not scale.
The goal is trust, transparency, and reproducibility.
