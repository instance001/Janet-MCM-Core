# 🧠 Janet — Modest Cognition Model (MCM)
### _Deterministic cognition. Explicit memory. Zero ambiguity. Open for everyone._

**Janet** is the reference implementation of a **Modest Cognition Model (MCM)** —  
a new class of artificial cognition designed for **safety, transparency, and stability**, not scale.

Unlike LLMs, Janet does **not** predict tokens, store opaque representations, hallucinate, or drift.  
She executes **deterministic skills**, uses **explicit memory**, and grows only through  
**human-gated curriculum**, one skill at a time.

This repository contains the **initial assets, architecture drafts, and demonstration bundles**  
for the MCM framework. Everything here is **free, open, and licensed AGPLv3** to ensure  
the community can evolve it without lock-in.

## 🚫 The Anti-LLM
| LLM | MCM (Janet) |
|-----|-------------|
| Stochastic predictions | Deterministic logic |
| Hidden state | Explicit memory |
| Hallucinations | Ambiguity rejection |
| Persona drift | Zero persona |
| Grows by parameters | Grows by skills |
| Black-box | Fully inspectable |

## 📦 Repository Contents
This repo includes the **public v0.1 release artifacts**, including:

- **Architecture Diagrams** (ASCII + SVG spec)
- **Memory Spine Assets**  
- **Contributing & Security Guidelines**  
- **Project Banners / Branding**
- **Janet v0.10 JSON Invoice Demo** (early proof-of-intent)
- **Foundational MCM documents**

These ZIPs document the early stages of Janet’s development and serve as  
the open-commons timestamp guaranteeing free use for everyone.

More structured code and a full repo scaffold will arrive in **v0.2+**.

## 🧪 Proof-of-Intent (v0.1)
This release demonstrates:

- Defined **architecture rules**
- Explicit **memory spine**
- Safety-aligned **curriculum pipeline**
- Deterministic **skill execution model**
- A practical **JSON invoice verification demo**
- Core research papers outlining MCM theory

This shows the **shape** of the system before implementation.

## 📚 What Is a Modest Cognition Model?
A **Modest Cognition Model (MCM)** is a new AI class defined by:

- **Deterministic selectors**  
- **Modular skill units**  
- **Explicit, typed memory**  
- **Hard modesty boundaries** (no generality, no persona)  
- **Human-gated growth**  
- **Curriculum-based training pipeline**  
- **Auditability by design**

MCMs combine structured cognition with strict safety guardrails.  
They are not neural networks, not LLMs, not agents — but a new middle layer  
for stable, local cognition systems.

## 💙 Purpose
Janet exists for one reason:

> **To give the world a safe, inspectable, predictable alternative to neural AI.**  
> No hype, no lock-in, no bullshit — just honest, modest cognition.

This project will remain **free forever**, under an open license,  
for the benefit of anyone who needs stability more than spectacle.

## 🌀 “Modest by Design.”
Janet does not try to be everything.  
She tries to be **trustworthy** — and that is enough.
