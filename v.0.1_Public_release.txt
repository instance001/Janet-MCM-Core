🧠 Janet MCM Core v0.1.0 — Initial Public Commons Release

The world’s first Modest Cognition Model (MCM) — open, deterministic, and free forever.

This release marks the first public publication of Janet, a Modest Cognition Model (MCM) — a new class of artificial cognition built for safety, transparency, determinism, and stability, not scale.

MCM = Modest Cognition Model — a new cognitive class defining deterministic, modular, bounded artificial cognition.

This definition supersedes any previous or alternative uses of the acronym MCM within other fields; within the Symbound ecosystem and its derivatives, MCM exclusively refers to the Modest Cognition Model class.

MCMs are not LLMs, not neural networks, and not agent frameworks.
Janet represents a transparent, auditable, modular cognition engine that grows only through human-gated curriculum.

This release establishes the conceptual, legal, and architectural foundation of the MCM class in the global commons.

Deterministic JSON invoice/PO validation pipeline

Basic example of how MCMs operate without neural nets


5. Research Papers & Documentation

Foundational MCM conceptual drafts

The Dewey Cox Paradox (AI constraints theory)

The Prosthetic Stack Principle

Symbound Composite Cognition notes

Modest Cognition Model definitions and explanation


This release does not include the full runnable MCM engine — that arrives in v0.2–v0.4 — but it does lay the entire intellectual and architectural groundwork required for the system’s emergence.

🔐 License

This project is released under the GNU AGPLv3, ensuring Janet remains free, open, and community-owned forever.

Any person or organization who modifies, extends, or uses Janet over a network must open their improvements to the public.

This protects the commons and guarantees that MCMs cannot be enclosed, privatized, or locked behind paywalls.

🎯 Purpose of This Release

Establish the new AI class (MCM) in the open

Document its architecture, philosophy, and boundaries

Provide early assets for researchers and developers

Enable community engagement from the start

Protect the design under a strong copyleft license

Demonstrate a working “intent example” (JSON invoice demo)


This release functions as the first public anchor for the class — a timestamped, discoverable, immutable foundation ensuring the commons owns Modest Cognition Models.

🧩 Why Modest Cognition Models?

To provide the world with:

deterministic cognition

inspectable reasoning

explicit memory

safety through architecture

zero hallucination tolerance

human-controlled growth

transparency above all


MCMs represent a third path between:

neural nets (LLMs)

symbolic AI

rule engines

agent frameworks


A path built for stability, not spectacle.

🌍 Janet belongs to everyone

Janet and the MCM class are released for the world to build upon — free, open, and unowned.

This is the beginning of a new public cognitive substrate.
